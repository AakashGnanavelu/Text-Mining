# Text-Mining

Text Mining is the process of converting unstructured text to a structured format for analysis. The software uses Natural Language Processing, which allows the computer to understand languages as it is written or spoken. The analysis identifies concepts, pattterns, and keywords.


Text mining has many different applications in the real world, as many of the communications is done using text. This allows businesses and other coorperations to find the patterns in the emails. messages, and in social media platforms to allow them to improve their products to meet their customers' demands. We can see text-mining being applied in social media, where harmful comments are being banned before they are sent, in email services, where potential fraud mails are sent to the junk box, preventing scams fromt taking place, we also see it to identify customer opinions.

With the data, a word cloud can be created. The most repeating concepts and keywords are shown in bigger text otwards the centre, with less frequent words around the side.
